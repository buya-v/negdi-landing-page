## Iteration 1

## Insights & Optimizations

### 1. Optimization: Wrap major UI sections in React Error Boundaries to isolate component crashes, and implement graceful degradation for all API interactions by displaying fallback UI states or cached data instead of allowing unhandled exceptions or empty views.

### 2. Optimization: Optimization Instruction: "Wrap major UI architecture blocks in React Error Boundaries to isolate component-level exceptions and implement graceful degradation for all API interactions by rendering explicit fallback UI states during data fetching failures."

### 3. Loop Analysis: The same error "Quality issues detected..." has occurred 3 times. Previous optimization strategies are not addressing the root cause.
